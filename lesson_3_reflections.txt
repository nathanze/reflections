When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I would use a remote repository to share my work with others, or to collaborate with others on a project.
I could also use it to work on the project from any device.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date 
with your remote repository?

To avoid the possibility of changes made to the remote files unexpectedly affecting my local files.
