When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I would use a remote repository to share my work with others, or to collaborate with others on a project.
I could also use it to work on the project from any device.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date 
with your remote repository?

To avoid the possibility of changes made to the remote files unexpectedly affecting my local files.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A clone copies a remote repository on a Github account onto your local system. A fork copies a respository from Github account
to another. A branch allows you to keep a master copy while you experiment with making changes on a new branch.
You use a fork to create a copy of someone's repository into your own account on Github. You clone that repository
when you download it to your local repository. You create a branch when you wish to maintain a master copy while 
trying something or making a change that you do not want to immediately appear on your master copy.
