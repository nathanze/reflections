What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When I initialize a repository, it creates a hidden folder containing the files necessary to 
track the commits I make.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is different from the working directory in that it does not necessarily include all of the files 
in the directory. It is just a temporary place that holds the file(s) that are being prepared to commit to the 
repository. It allows you to make commits that only affect the files that logically should be included in the commit
together.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

I can use the staging area to include only the files related to the logical change before making the commit.
